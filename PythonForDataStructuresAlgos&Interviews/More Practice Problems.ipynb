    "### Problem 1\n",
    "A tower has 100 floors. You've been given two eggs. The eggs are strong enough that they can be dropped from a particular floor in the tower without breaking. You've been tasked to find the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking, in as few drops as possible. If an egg is dropped from above its target floor it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be intact and you can test drop the egg again on another floor.\n",
    "Show algorithmically how you would go about doing this in as few drops as possible\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Use paper/pencil or a whiteboard for this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "We've already seen this problem in the Riddles section, here is the answer from that section.(Alternatively just google \"2 eggs 100 floors\" for a plethora of explanations regarding this same solution\n",
    "Start from the 10th floor and go up to floors in multiples of 10.\n",
    "If first egg breaks, say at 20th floor then you can check all the floors between 11th and 19th with the second egg to see which floor it will not break.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the worst-case number of drops is 19. If the threshold was 99th floor, then you would have to drop the first egg 10 times and the second egg 9 times in linear fashion.\n",
    "Best solution: We need to minimize this worst-case number of drops. For that, we need to generalize the problem to have n floors. What would be the step value, for the first egg? Would it still be 10? Suppose we have 200 floors. Would the step value be still 10?\n",
    "\n",
    "The point to note here is that we are trying to minimize the worst-case number of drops which happens if the threshold is at the highest floors. So, our steps should be of some value which reduces the number of drops of the first egg.\n",
    "Let's assume we take some step value m initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "If every subsequent step is m-1, then,\n",
    "m+m−1+m−2+.....+1=n\n",
    "m+m−1+m−2+.....+1=n\n",
    "\n",
    "This is\n",
    "m∗(m+1)2=n\n",
    "m∗(m+1)2=n\n",
    "\n",
    "If n =100, then m would be 13.65 which since we can't drop from a decimal of a floor, we actually use 14.\n",
    "So, the worst case scenario is now when the threshold is in the first 14 floors with number of drops being 14.\n",
    "Note that this is simply a binary search!"

    "### Problem 2\n",
    "You've been given a list of historical stock prices for a single day for Amazon stock. The index of the list represents the timestamp, so the element at index of 0 is the initial price of the stock, the element at index 1 is the next recorded price of the stock for that day, etc. Your task is to write a function that will return the maximum profit possible from the purchase and sale of a single share of Amazon stock on that day. Keep in mind to try to make this as efficient as possible.\n",
    "For example, if you were given the list of stock prices:\n",
    "prices = [12,11,15,3,10]\n",
    "Then your function would return the maximum possible profit, which would be 7 (buying at 3 and selling at 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Let's think about a few things before we start coding. One thing to think about right off the bat is that we can't just find the maximum price and the lowest price and then subtract the two, because the max could come before the min.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force method would be to try every possible pair of price combinations, but this would be O(N^2), pretty bad. Also since this is an interview setting you should probably already know that there is a smarter solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will use a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) approach. We will iterate through the list of stock prices while keeping track of our maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means for every price we will keep track of the lowest price so far and then check if we can get a better profit than our current max."

    "Because the 5 sided dice can not produce 7 possible outcomes on a single roll, we immediately know that we need to roll the dice at least twice.\n",
    "If we roll the dice twice we have 25 possible combinations of the results of the two rolls. While 25 is not divisible by 7, 21 is. This means we can implement our previous strategy of throwing out rolls not in our intended range.\n",
    "It's also important to note that we can't expand the solution to implement more rolls in order to not throw any out, because 5 and 7 are both prime which means that no exponent of 5 will be divisible by 7 no matter how high you go.\n",
    "We will define our range as a section of the 25 possible combinations of rolls. A good way to do this is by converting the two rolls into a unique outcome number in the range 1 through 25.\n",
    "We will create this number by taking the rolls, then we take the first roll and after subtracting 1 from it we multiply it by 4. Now the first roll corresponds with a value of 1 - 20.\n",
    "Then we take the second roll and add it to the result of the first manipulation. Giving us a range of 1-25.\n",
    "So our final solution is to roll the dice twice. Check the manipulated range from 1 to 25, if its greater than 21, do a reroll."

    "So, we should keep track of the minimum and maximum values a node can take. And at each node we will check whether its value is between the min and max values it’s allowed to take. The root can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity. At any node, its left child should be smaller than or equal than its own value, and similarly the right child should be larger than or equal to. So during recursion, we send the current value as the new max to our left child and send the min as it is without changing. And to the right child, we send the current value as the new min and send the max without changing."

If the input is guaranteed to be in standard ASCII form, we can just create a boolean array of size 128 and perform lookups by accessing the index of the character’s ASCII value in constant time. But if the string is Unicode then we would need a much larger array of size more than 100K, which will be a waste since most of it would generally be unused.\n",

So, we’ll loop over the characters of the string, and at each iteration we’ll check whether we have seen the current character before by searching the set. If it’s in the set then it means we’ve seen it before, so we ignore it. Otherwise, we include it in the result and add it to the set to keep track for future reference. "
